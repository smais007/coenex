# File Sharing System - Issue Fixes & Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Server Actions Body Size Limit (413 Error)**

- **Problem**: Next.js Server Actions have a default 1MB limit, but we were allowing larger files
- **Solution**: Updated `next.config.ts` to increase limit to 15MB with server actions body size limit
- **Changes**:
  ```typescript
  experimental: {
    serverActions: {
      bodySizeLimit: '15mb', // Increase limit for file uploads
    },
  },
  ```

### 2. **Supabase Storage Connection Timeout**

- **Problem**: Connection timeouts when uploading to Supabase Storage
- **Solution**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff in `uploadFile` server action
- **Changes**:
  - Retry up to 3 times on upload failure
  - Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
  - Better error messages for different failure types
  - Specific handling for timeout and size errors

### 3. **File Size Configuration Mismatch**

- **Problem**: UI showed 50MB limit but this was causing issues
- **Solution**: Reduced to more reasonable 10MB limit
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `FILE_SHARING_CONFIG.maxFileSize` to 10MB
  - Updated help text in upload form
  - Aligned Next.js body limit with file size limit

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- **Client-side**: Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Server-side**: Retry logic and detailed error logging
- **User feedback**: Specific messages for timeouts, size limits, and connection issues

### 2. **Upload Progress Indication**

- Added progress bar component
- Real-time status updates during upload
- Visual feedback for encryption and upload stages

### 3. **Better User Experience**

- Progress percentage display
- Dynamic status messages ("Preparing file...", "Encrypting and uploading...")
- Improved error messages with actionable advice

## Technical Details

### Server Action Retry Logic

```typescript
let uploadAttempts = 0;
const maxRetries = 3;

while (uploadAttempts < maxRetries) {
  try {
    // Upload attempt
    if (success) break;

    uploadAttempts++;
    if (uploadAttempts < maxRetries) {
      // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, uploadAttempts) * 1000));
    }
  } catch (err) {
    // Handle retry
  }
}
```

### Progress Tracking

```typescript
const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState(0);
const [uploadStatus, setUploadStatus] = useState<string>("");

// During upload:
setUploadStatus("Preparing file..."); // 0%
setUploadProgress(25); // Encrypting
setUploadStatus("Encrypting and uploading..."); // 25%
setUploadProgress(100); // Complete
```

### Error Classification

- **413/Body exceeded**: File too large message
- **timeout/fetch failed**: Connection timeout message
- **network/connection**: Network error message
- **Generic**: Fallback error message

## Configuration Updates

### File Size Limits

- **Previous**: 50MB (causing issues)
- **Current**: 10MB (more stable)
- **Next.js limit**: 15MB (with buffer)

### Retry Settings

- **Max retries**: 3 attempts
- **Backoff**: 1s, 2s, 4s
- **Total max time**: ~7 seconds

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Large files** (8-10MB): Should upload successfully with retry
2. **Network issues**: Should show appropriate retry behavior
3. **Very large files** (>10MB): Should show client-side validation error
4. **Connection timeouts**: Should retry automatically and show progress

## Monitoring

The system now logs:

- Upload attempt counts
- Specific error types
- Retry timing information
- Progress tracking

This provides better debugging information for any future issues.

## Next Steps

For production deployment:

1. Consider implementing chunked uploads for larger files
2. Add server-side rate limiting
3. Monitor Supabase connection performance
4. Consider CDN for better global upload performance
5. Add upload analytics and error tracking
